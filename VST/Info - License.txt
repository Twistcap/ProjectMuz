NOTE TO MULTI CORE PROCESSOR USERS - There is a problem with running multiple instances of FreeAmp on multi processor machines re: duel core, quad core systems. This is a bug with SynthEdit and is being worked on now.
There is a work-around - Copy and paste the .dll file and rename (example) FA36_Full.dll copy\paste and rename FA36_Full2.dll, FA36_Full3.dll. You may make as many copies as you need instances just give different names to all of them and load them seperate. Sorry about the bug will fix as soon as I can fix.


Setup - Hook up your guitar to your soundcard with a line level matching device (DI box, mic preamp). For low latencies a fast ASIO soundcard is required. The level you send to FreeAmp3 is very important to the pre-amp clipping stages and should be as close as possible to 0db input without clipping the inputs analog to digital converter of your soundcard.

Input selector - Used to setup for stereo or mono input. When set to guitar the input is mono and only the left input works. When set to stereo the left and right inputs are combined to mono and level compensated.

Signal flow -

In -> PreGate -> FX1\Pedal -> Amp\Eq\Speakers -> PostGate -> FX2\Rack -> Limiter -> Out

Tip - Use the "CHUB" control to match FreeAmp3 to your guitar. Turn the "CHUB" down if the tone gets muddy or dull sounding when you reduce your guitars volume control. Increase the "CHUB" to fatten up the tone.

Sorry for no manual, just don’t have the time right now.
